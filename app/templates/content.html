                        Sorry I didn’t get to write last night! It was such a busy day, and I was too tired to write 
                        anything...


                        I was right about Sarah not being okay. Yesterday, she barely spoke to me, and anything she 
                        did say was a “yes” or “no” answer.  I tried so hard to get her to cheer up, but of course she 
                        just kept saying, “I’m fine, I’m fine.” Uggh! I wish she would just be honest with me! I’m always 
                        honest with her! It’s not fair!
                        
                </p>

                <p>
                        Jane also seemed mad all day because she could tell that Sarah was being fake nice to her. I hate 
                        being in the middle of all of this. What am I supposed to do? Sarah’s been my friend since forever,
                         and Jane is my new friend, and I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings! But I think that Jane is 
                         right about Sarah. I think Sarah sometimes gets too dramatic about things. She’s being kind of a 
                         brat about all of this, but I don’t want to tell her that to her face, she’d never forgive me.
                        
                        
                        I wish things were simple like they were in elementary school
